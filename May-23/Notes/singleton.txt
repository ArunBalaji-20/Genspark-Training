singleton

-----------------
1. Singleton
	Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

	steps:
	Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.

Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.

Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.

Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.

Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.

example: 
FileOperations.cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace DesignPatterns.Singleton
{
    public class FileOperations
    {
        private static FileOperations instance;
        private  string name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        private FileOperations() { }

        public static FileOperations GetInstance(string n)
        {
            if(instance == null)
            {
                instance = new FileOperations();
                instance.name = n;
                return instance;
            }
            return instance;
        }

        public  void TestFunction()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Testfunction called by: {name}");
        }
    }
}

Program.cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using DesignPatterns.Singleton;
namespace DesignPatterns
{
    public class program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            FileOperations fileop1 = FileOperations.GetInstance("arun");

            fileop1.TestFunction();

            FileOperations fileop2 = FileOperations.GetInstance("balaji");

            fileop2.TestFunction();
        }
        
    }
}

output:
Testfunction called by: arun
Testfunction called by: arun
