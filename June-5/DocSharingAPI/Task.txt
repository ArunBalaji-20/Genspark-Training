ocuNotify is a document-sharing API designed for internal team collaboration in an organization. The primary goals are to allow secure file uploads, restrict access to only authorized personnel, and notify all connected users in real-timewhenever a new document is added.


The HR department of a company wants to securely share onboarding documents with internal staff. Only HR admins are allowed to upload documents. Once uploaded, all logged-in users should instantly be notified so they can access the new document.
The IT team is tasked with building a backend API that supports:
* Role-based authentication using JWT
* Secure file upload and storage
* Real-time client notifications using SignalR
