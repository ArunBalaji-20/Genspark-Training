streaming replication:
---------------------
Streaming replication is a popular method you can use to horizontally scale your relational databases. It uses two or more copies of the same database cluster running on separate machines. One database cluster is referred to as the primary and serves both read and write operations;

backup


There are three fundamentally different approaches to backing up PostgreSQL data:

1)SQL dump 
	1.a) pgdump:
	The idea behind this dump method is to generate a file with SQL commands that, when fed back to the server, will recreate the database in the same 	state as it was at the time of the dump. PostgreSQL provides the utility program pg_dump for this purpose. The basic usage of this command is:

	pg_dump dbname > dumpfile

	1.b) restore dump :
	Restoring the Dump : psql -X dbname < dumpfile
	
	1.c) pgdumpall:
	pg_dumpall > dumpfile
	The resulting dump can be restored with psql: psql -X -f dumpfile postgres


2)File system level backup
	An alternative backup strategy is to directly copy the files that PostgreSQL uses to store the data in the database
	command: tar -cf backup.tar /usr/local/pgsql/data
	Note: The database server must be shut down in order to get a usable backup

3)Continuous archiving
	 Restore a PostgreSQL cluster to a specific point in time, even in the middle of a transaction. Replay Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) to any point after your last base backup
