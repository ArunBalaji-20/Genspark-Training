Grant command

The GRANT command has two basic variants: 
1) one that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure, procedural language, large object, configuration parameter, schema, tablespace, or type)

The possible privileges are: SELECT ,INSERT ,UPDATE,DELETE,TRUNCATE,REFERENCES ,TRIGGER ,CREATE, CONNECT ,TEMPORARY, EXECUTE, USAGE ,SET ,ALTER ,SYSTEM, MAINTAIN

2)one that grants membership in a role.

	This variant of the GRANT command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles, and the modification of membership options SET, INHERIT, and ADMIN;

examples: 
Grant insert privilege to all users on table films:

GRANT INSERT ON films TO PUBLIC;
Grant all available privileges to user manuel on view kinds:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds TO manuel;
Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a superuser or the owner of kinds, when executed by someone else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has grant options.

Grant membership in role admins to user joe:

GRANT admins TO joe;
